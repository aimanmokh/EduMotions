EduMotion is a project focused on facial emotion analysis for student feedback in educational settings. The aim is to enhance engagement and educational outcomes by developing a real-time facial emotion detection system that integrates into classroom environments. This system helps understand student emotions during lectures, provides immediate feedback to educators, and dynamically adjusts teaching methods to improve learning experiences. The project utilizes advanced image processing techniques, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and machine learning models, leveraging datasets like FER2013 from Kaggle.
